									<p>After graduation in December of 2021, I started working at Levytyö Särkinen as a

  									<li>Equality Plan</li>
										<li>Whole company's legal compliance inspection</li>
										<li>Monthly website revisions</li>
										<li>Company reports to Statistics Finland</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										The role of a project specialist taught me enormously about wide variety of subjects.
										Overall, it made me a more well rounded professional since after that position
										 my core competences are not only limited to my field of education.
